## ROBLOX UPDATES
Be aware that when roblox updates you have to run RBXNo60 again (shouldn't take much time if you let rbxno60 save and apply settings)!

## About RBXNo60

cool and simple fps uncapper and optimizer for roblox

RBXNo60 helps you get:
* better fps
* uncap fps to any number that you would like
* potato mode for trash computers
* im stupid

Of course, rbxno60 may not serve all your needs. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

## Built With

c#

## Usage

this is very userfriendly so I won't have to explain everything but the install â†“ since its complicated.
By the way, you can add your own flags in the settings.json (if you let rbxno60 save and apply settings)!

## Install

If it shows virus detected, its not a virus. Here are the steps to enable RBXNo60 without disabling Windows Defender for everything

* Search virus & threat protection and click open
