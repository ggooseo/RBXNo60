cool and simple fps uncapper and optimizer for roblox

RBXNo60 helps you get:
* better fps
* uncap fps to any number that you would like
* potato mode for trash computers
* im stupid

Of course, rbxno60 may not serve all your needs. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

## Built With

c#

## Usage

INSTALL: If it shows virus detected, its not a virus. Here are the steps to enable RBXNo60 without disabling Windows Defender for everything
wait

this is very userfriendly so I won't have to explain everything but you can add your own flags in the settings.json (if you let rbxno60 save and apply settings)!

## ROBLOX UPDATES
Be aware that when roblox updates you have to run RBXNo60 again (shouldn't take much time if you let rbxno60 save and apply settings)!
